1. INTRODUCTION

    Pythonium Falcon is a copy of [Atarenium Falcon](https://github.com/Last-Minute-Creations/AtareniumFalcon), a simple "puzzle solving" game. 
   
    The original was written using C language and Amiga C Engine, and was my first bigger project to learn programming. 
    Then I decided to learn some Python, and re-write the game using Pygame. I tried to stick with the original Atarenium Falcon "architecture" with all the mistakes I made along the way, like using global variables instead of passing arguments (yep, I know it's bad), repetitive code in places where I wasn't able to clean it yet, and so on. There are some differences, like managing all the 'game states' in main game loop, for now I don't know how to make it better, but looks like it's working (and main loop is hard to read of course).

    Work in progress(most of elements looks like working ok), to do list:

    * amiga-mode features (HUD mostly)
    * transition into amiga mode in game
    * fade-out at the end of each level
    * portal and collect item animation (scanline & correct blitting)
    * ESP

    Run with menu.py
